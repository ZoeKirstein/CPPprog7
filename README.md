initialize integer 'total' and define it as zero.
initialize character 'input' and then read in an input for it.
initialize integer 'count' and define it as zero.

as long as character 'input' is not "!", translate letter passed into 'character' to its number form, add it to integer 'total', and then and set integer 'total' to that new value.

increment 'count'

read in new value for 'input'.

if value of 'total' becomes greater than 100, print "Too many '(value of count)'" with an endline and then exit the program w/ a return value of zero.

if the value of 'input' is "!", print the value of 'total' with an endline.
